                    <h2>My Role</h2>
                    <p>In this project I performed product and visual design, and conducted user research. 
                       The aim of the project
                        was to 
                        determinine the freemium features for XUND’s mobile app and the placement of the signup wall in
                        the
                        application’s workflow.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Challenge </h2>
                    <p> The biggest challenge of the project was conducting the study and incorporating its findings into the app in accordance with
                       the release timeline for the app in the App store. The recommended changes were added to the app on schedule, making the project a success. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Study</h2>
                    <p> I designed a quantitative questionnaire to validate the proposed concepts. The responses to the questionnaire
                        proved the company was on the right
                        track, and they were able to adjust the features to be more in line with the user’s needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>The questionnaire was followed by UI mockups that incorporated these suggestions. In order to meet the limited 
                        timeline, the team had to communicate effectively and the study had to be conducted rapidly.
                       In order to meet the limited timeline the team had to communicate effectively and and the study had to be completed on time.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Project Outcomes</h2>
                    <p>We validated the features included in the free version of the app. The study helped the company
                        make final
                        tweaks to the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>We also reviewed the app flow and changed positioning of some features, such as signup flow. The 
                        mobile app is now
                        available in the App Store for Austria region.
