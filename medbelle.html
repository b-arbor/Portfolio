                    <h2>My Role</h2>
                    <p>In this project I was Product Designer, UX Researcher and Visual Designer. The aim was to design
                       mobile-first Outcome Tracking System Application. </p>


                    <h2>The Challenge </h2>
                    <p>No one likes filling out surveys, especially when there’s no incentive for the participant.
                        Surveys,
                        forms and other forms of market research are perceived by users tedious and often unpleasant.
                    </p>
                    <figure class="text-center">
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">
                            Users want easy. Developers want simple.
                        </blockquote>
                        <figcaption class="blockquote-footer">
                            Rich Hickey in <cite title="Source Title">Simple Made Easy</cite>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        This is especially true when it comes to market research tools and survey designs. The real
                        challenge
                        was bringing
                        to the table design that's simple yet beautiful, nudging users towards full survey completion.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Design</h2>
                    <p>I knew that design needs to be clean and simple for easy readability on primarily mobile devices.
                        I used
                        icons to mark
                        responses for the questionnaires with likert-scale questions to capture the attention of the
                        audience.
                        Progress bar shows
                        users how far they are and how many more questions are awaiting them contributing to the average
                        completion rate as many
                        people abandon filling out surveys when not knowing how long it will take. </p>

                    <h2>Working Towards Business Goals </h2>
                    <p>The goal of quality management tool is to successfully collect the data. I wanted to make it
                        simple and
                        timeless so the 
                        created design could serve for years to come with minimum maintenance. I also took in the
                        consideration
                        the fact
                        that before any market research participants always have the questions that are covered by
                        following
                        categories:
                    </p>
                    <div class="container">
                        <ul>
                            <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">How long will this take?</span> - making sure to
                                inform the audience how long will the survey will take so they
                                can set
                                their expectations and not abandon it halfway. </li>
                            <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why are you asking me this?</span> - communicate to
                                your audience why this is important. Users need to know why they should
                                compromise
                                their time to your cause.
                            </li>
                            <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">What am I getting out of this?</span> - what is the
                                incentive for taking part in this?
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>The survey design considered all the above questions. This strategic thinking helped set
                        right
                        expectations
                        for the users and gave them an accurate sense of the whole survey process.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Mobile-friendly</h2>
                    <p> Most company’s website traffic comes from mobile devices. It was crucial to design a product
                        that would
                        look
                        good on smaller mobile screens and is easily tappable.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Project Outcomes</h2>
                    <p>With my wireframes engineering was able to easily develop the missing feature and ship the item
                        very
                        quickly.
                        This project saved a lot of time, nerves and resources for the development team.

                        Now the Medbelle team has tool aiding them to quantitatively measure customer satisfaction and they are
                        using these
                        numbers to
                        improve their services. </p>
